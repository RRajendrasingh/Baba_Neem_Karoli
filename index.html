            <h2>MIRACLE OF BABA</h2>
            <p>
                Once, a woman came to Baba Neem Karoli seeking his help. Her husband had been diagnosed with cancer and
                the doctors had given up hope. The woman was desperate and didn't know where to turn.
                Baba Neem Karoli listened to her story and then took a small amount of ash from his pipe and gave it to
                her. He told her to mix it with water and give it to her husband to drink. The woman was skeptical but
                decided to try it anyway.
                When she got home, she mixed the ash with water and gave it to her husband. To her amazement, he began
                to improve almost immediately. Within a few weeks, he was completely cured of his cancer.
                The woman returned to Baba Neem Karoli to thank him and asked him how the ash had worked. Baba Neem
                Karoli smiled and said, "It wasn't the ash that cured your husband, it was your faith. Your faith in me
                and in God is what healed him."
                This story is just one example of the many miracles that Baba Neem Karoli was believed to have
                performed. He had a reputation for healing the sick and performing other miraculous feats, but he always
                attributed the miracles to the power of faith and devotion to God.
                Baba Neem Karoli's teachings emphasized the importance of love and compassion, and he believed that by
                cultivating these qualities, one could attain a deep connection with the divine. He saw all beings as
                manifestations of God and encouraged his followers to serve others with selfless love and devotion.
                Today, Baba Neem Karoli is still remembered as a beloved saint and spiritual teacher, and his teachings
                continue to inspire people around the world.
