            <h1>Philosophy</h1>
            <p>
                Neem Karoli Baba was a lifelong adept of bhakti yoga, andencouraged service to others (seva) as the
                highest form ofunconditional devotion to God. In the book Miracle of Love,compiled by Ram Dass, a
                devotee named Anjani shares thefollowing account:
            </p> <br>

            <p>There can be no biography of him. Facts are few,stories many. He seems to have been known bydifferent
                names in many parts of India, appearing anddisappearing through the years. His non-Indiandevotees of
                recent years knew him as Neem KaroliBaba, but mostly as “Maharajji”. Just as he said, hewas "nobody". He
                gave no discourses; the briefest,simplest stories were his teachings. Usually, he sat orlay on a wooden
                bench wrapped in a plaid blanketwhile a few devotees sat around him. Visitors cameand went; they were
                given food, a few words, a nod, apat on the head or back, and they were sent away.There was gossip and
                laughter for he loved to joke.Orders for running the ashram were given, usually in apiercing yell across
                the compound. Sometimes he satin silence, absorbed in another world to which wecould not follow, but
                bliss and peace poured down onus. Who he was was no more than the experience ofhim, the nectar of his
                presence, the totality of hisabsence, enveloping us now like his plaid blanket.

                Baba would say that attachment and ego are the greatest hindrances to the realisation of God and that
                “alearned man and a fool are alike as long as there is attachment and ego in the physical body.” He
                wouldadvise people to surrender to God's will above everything else so that they might develop love and
                faith inhim and thereby be free of unnecessary worries in life.
